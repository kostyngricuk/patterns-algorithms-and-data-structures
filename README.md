A comprehensive collection of the most popular **design patterns**, **algorithms**, and **data structures** implemented in **TypeScript**. This project serves as both a learning resource and a reference guide for developers looking to master fundamental computer science concepts.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and explanations of:

- **🏗️ Design Patterns** - Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns
- **⚡ Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and more
- **📊 Data Structures** - Arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables, and beyond

Each topic includes:

- ✅ TypeScript implementation with full type safety
- 📚 Detailed explanations and use cases
- ⏱️ Time and space complexity analysis
- 🧪 Comprehensive test cases

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kostyngricuk/patterns-algorithms-and-data-structures.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd patterns-algorithms-and-data-structures

# Install dependencies
yarn install
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Start the development server
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## 🛠️ Development

### Build for Production

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Type Checking

```bash
yarn typecheck
```

### Serve Built Site Locally

```bash
yarn serve
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Using SSH

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

### Using HTTPS

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Add unit tests for all implementations
3. Update documentation accordingly
4. Ensure code passes linting and type checking
