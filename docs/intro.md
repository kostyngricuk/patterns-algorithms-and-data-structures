# Introduction

Welcome to **Patterns, Algorithms and Data Structures** - a comprehensive guide to fundamental computer science concepts with practical JavaScript implementations.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation covers essential topics for software developers:

- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms for searching, sorting, and problem-solving
- **Data Structures**: Fundamental data structures and their implementations
- **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common software design problems

## Getting Started

Explore the documentation to learn about different algorithms and data structures. Each topic includes:

- Detailed explanations of concepts
- Time and space complexity analysis
- JavaScript implementation examples
- Test cases demonstrating usage

## Running the Examples

All examples are located in the `examples/` directory and include unit tests.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above
- Yarn package manager

### Installation

Install dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running Tests

Execute all tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

Run tests for a specific algorithm:

```bash
yarn test <algorithm-name>
```

### Development Server

Start the documentation site locally:

```bash
yarn start
```
